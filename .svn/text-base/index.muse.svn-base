* Emacs Freex minor mode

Emacs Freex mode is a minor mode for organizing
massively-hyperlinked notes and notes and ideas. It's a
personal wiki on steroids.

Per Sederberg & Greg Detre are hoping to release freex under
a GPL license as soon as possible. Email
greg@remove-this.gregdetre.co.uk for more info.
