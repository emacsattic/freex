<p>[This is a moderately techical tutorial that also shows you
some of the backend. We're working on a more user-level
tutorial.</p>


<h3><a name="sec2" id="sec2"></a>
Creating our first nuggets</h3>

<p class="first">The first thing to do is to <a href="install.html">download and install</a> Freex.</p>

<p>Assuming that's all working, the next step is to create a
new .freex file. As soon as you save this, freex will
automatically create and initialize your database.</p>

<p>To do this, just open up a new file in your data directory -
let's call it 'emacs.freex'. Type in some text like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;emacs outshines all other editing software in
approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the
stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes
everything else vanish&quot;.</em> &mdash; <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">Neal Stephenson</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, save it. Congratulations - you just added your first
nugget to the database. To test this, try typing 'emacs', or
just editing the line above that contains the word
'emacs'. You should see it now highlighted with a link. Try
putting the cursor over 'emacs' and pressing
ENTER... nothing happens. That's because you just followed a
link right back to where you already were.</p>

<p>Time to create another nugget. Let's call it
'lisp.freex'. Fill it with some text, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A girl goes to the doctor to have her cold
treated. The doctor lifts up her top to listen to her
chest and says, &quot;nice big breaths.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">The girl replies, &quot;Yeth, and I'm only 14!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that if you type 'emacs' now, place the cursor on it,
and press ENTER, you will be magically transported to the
'emacs' nugget.</p>

<p>[We use the term 'nugget' throughout to mean 'document' or
'piece of text', since nuggets will not always equate to
files. More on this later.]</p>



<h3><a name="sec3" id="sec3"></a>
Going behind the scenes</h3>

<p class="first">So now we have two nuggets. Let's examine a little what's
going on behind the scenes before we carry on. Peek at your
data directory. You should see something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
66 budokan:.../freex/testdocs&gt;ll
total 32K
drwxrwxr-x 12 greg greg 4.0K 2007-09-19 05:03 ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 greg greg   17 2007-09-19 05:04 emacs.freex
-rw-rw-r--  1 greg greg    8 2007-09-19 05:04 lisp.freex
-rw-r--r--  1 greg greg  11K 2007-09-19 05:04 freex.db
drwxrwxr-x  3 greg greg 4.0K 2007-09-19 05:11 .
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>As you'd expect, both of the .freex files are plain ascii
text, containing whatever you typed. The real magic is
hidden inside freex.db. Fire up sqlite (by typing 'sqlite'
or maybe 'sqlite3') so that we can peer inside it:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
62 budokan:.../freex/testdocs&gt;sqlite freex.db
SQLite version 3.3.13
Enter &quot;.help&quot; for instructions
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and enter the following query:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
select * from nuggets;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very simple SQL query that's asking the database
to tell us everything it knows about the nuggets in our
database. It reports back:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
1| emacs outshines all other [snip] |2007-09-19 05:03:53.410275|emacs.freex
2| A girl goes to the doctor [snip] |2007-09-19 05:04:36.098915|lisp.freex
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can probably guess, this tells us that:</p>

<ul>
<li>we have 2, with primary keys of 1 and 2 respectively</li>
<li>spits out their contents (mirrored in the database for
convenience)</li>
<li>and their creation dates</li>
<li>and tells us their filenames</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're curious, you can inspect the database further. To
see the full schema:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
select * from sqlite_master;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely worth a muse, but beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p>Just for completeness, let's take a quick spin in python,
which provides the backend interface to the database to
emacs, before we jump back into the driver's seat. Fire up
a python or ipython shell, and try something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
from freex_sqlalchemy import *
fsqa = create_fsqa('/home/greg/docs/freex/freex.db',False,file_ext='freex')
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>'freex_sqlalchemy.py' contains all the backend python
database code, and provides the API that emacs uses for
getting and setting nuggets. The three arguments to
'create_fsqa' tell it:</p>

<ul>
<li>to load (or create) the freex.db sqlite database</li>
<li>not to use any lisp code (since we're not calling it
from within emacs)</li>
<li>and that our files have a .freex extension.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we can start to query the database:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
In [2]: get_all_aliases()
Out[2]: ['emacs', 'python']
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>Ok. Enough infrastructure. Let's play some more. Open Emacs
up again. Create a new .freex file called
'elisp.freex'. Now, we want to represent the fact that
'elisp' belongs to both 'emacs' and 'lisp'. If 'emacs' and
'lisp' were directories, this would be like saying that we wanted
'elisp' to exist in both.</p>

<p>This is easy to do. Just run M-x
freex-meta-insert-metadata-here (C-cm), and you should see a
grey metadata overlay appear in the midst of your text. It
tells you a bunch of things you already know, but the fun
part is that it got all this by querying the database, and
if you edit the fields, you'll be able to transparently
update the database. Just place your cursor inside the small
darker grey box to the right of 'tag-parents', and type:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="example">
emacs; lisp
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the tag-parents line should look like this:</p>

<p class="image-link"><img src="elisp.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, save as normal, and then press C-cm again. You should
find that the modtime field has updated, indicating that the
data has been written to the database. [You can banish the
metadata overlay with M-x
freex-embed-remove-overlay-at-point (C--).]</p>

<p>Let's test this out. If 'elisp' belongs to
'emacs', then that means that 'emacs' owns (is the parent
of) 'elisp', right? Open up 'emacs', and look at its
metadata. You should see that its tag-children contains
'elisp' now.</p>

<p>Play around with this. Let's try adding a tag-parent for a
nugget that doesn't exist yet. Make 'lisp' belong to
'programming'. Voila! You should now have a
'programming.freex'. Before we go any further, make sure
that you've set things up so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>'elisp' has 'emacs' and 'lisp' as tag-parents</li>
<li>'lisp' has 'programming' as a tag-parent</li>
</ul>

<p>For the final part of the tutorial, I'm
going to try and demonstrate a pretty meaty idea, so saddle
up your mind.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a bunch of nuggets, each with various
tag-parents, and you want to find a nugget. Maybe you want
to find the nugget for the Emacs programming language, but
you've forgotten what it's called. Try M-x freex-meta-find
(C-cm). Type 'programming/emacs/' and then hit TAB. In fact,
you could have tab-completed multiple times as you were
typing those, just as with files.  Every time you hit TAB,
you're actually querying the database. Think of the '/' as
denoting 'has tag-parent'. That query is asking "which
nuggets have both 'emacs' and 'programming' as tag-parents?"
With any luck, it should tab-complete to 'elisp'. Hit ENTER
to open it up. That's the easiest way to open up (or even
create) freex nuggets.</p>

<p>Now wait just one darn cotton-picking minute. We specified
that 'elisp' belongs to both 'emacs' and 'lisp'. And we
specified that 'lisp' belongs to 'programming'. But we never
specified that <em>'elisp'</em> belongs to 'programming'. So how did it
know. Basically, freex-meta-find allows for second-order
parenting relationships. Almost as though grandparents
(though currently not great-grandparents) count as honorary
parents. This makes for a pretty powerful system, because it
means that you don't have to have so much redundancy in your
tagging. Anything that has 'lisp' as a tag-parent will also
have 'programming' as a parent, for free.</p>

<p>That's plenty of tutoring for now. Play around with creating
links, tag-parents and tag-children, and with freex-meta-find. Peek at the
database as you go, just to get a better idea of what's
going on.</p>
